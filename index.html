    <h2>Conception</h2>
    <p>
        The process of becoming pregnant involving fertilization or implantation or both. Conception is best calculated using your last menstral cycyle. Therefore, if you know the first day of period, you can add 11 to 21 days to this day to have an idea of when conception occurred. For example, if you are pregnant and your last period started on March 5, that means you likely conceived between March 16 and 26.

                How many days is conception?
            </summary>
            <p>It can take up to 6 days after sex for the sperm and egg to join â€” if a sperm cell joins with an egg, it's called fertilization. The fertilized egg moves towards your uterus. It gets to your uterus about 3-4 days after fertilization, and it can float around in your uterus for another few days</p>

            <h2>Conception and Implantation</h2>
        <p>
            About six days after fertilization: The fertilized egg implants into your uterine lining. Around day 21: If conception and implantation occurred during this menstrual cycle, you're pregnant
        </p>
        <p>There are four stages of implantation:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The blastocyst begins to hatch out of its shell</li>
            <li>The blastocyst continues to hatch out of its shell and begins to attach itself to the uterus.</li>
            <li>The blastocyst attaches deeper into the uterine lining, beginning implantation.</li>
            <li>Implantation continues</li>
